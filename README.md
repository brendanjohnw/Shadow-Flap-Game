# ShadowFlap

Built as part of the SWEN20003 Object Oriented Software Development course at the University of Melbourne

A replica of the famous flappy bird mobile game with a twist. The bird now has a life bar that changes between level 0 and 1.
In level one, players are able to pick up different weapons to attack different types of pipes. 
Flames will also spawn by steel pipes to attack the player's bird.
